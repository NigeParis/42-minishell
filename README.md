# 42-minishell

A long project at 42 in a group of two, the goal is to create  <br> 
a command interpreter that mimics the behavior of bash. <br> 

Minishell manages environment variables, launches programs and handles their return. <br> 
There are also have a number of built-in functions: <br> 

for example : <br> 
cd, <br> 
echo, <br> 
env, <br> 
exit, <br> 
export, <br> 
pwd, <br> 
unset. <br> 

Signal handling : <br> 

- CTRL + C sigint <br> 
- CTRL + D eof <br> 
- CTRL + \ sigquit <br>
